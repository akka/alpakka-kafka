## Documentation for version 0.10 or earlier

## Akka versions compatibility

Please note that while the library depends on Akka 2.4.x is fully compatible to be used with Akka 2.5.x.
This is because of Akka's strict [backwards compatibility guarantees](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.3/scala/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html). If you want to use reactive-kafka with Akka 2.5 simply include Akka **and** Akka Streams dependencies using the latest 2.5 version, for example like this:

```
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-stream" % "2.5.x" // pick the latest version here
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-actor" % "2.5.x"
```

Note that it is important that all `akka-*` dependencies are in the same version, so it is recommended to depend on them explicitly to avoid problems with transient dependencies causing an unlucky mix of versions.
