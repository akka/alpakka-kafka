Systems don't come alone. In the modern world of microservices and cloud deployment, new components must interact with legacy systems, making integration an important key to success. Reactive Streams give us a technology-independent tool to let these heterogeneous systems communicate without overwhelming each other.

The Alpakka project is an open source initiative to implement stream-aware, reactive, integration pipelines for Java and Scala. It is built on top of [Akka Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html), and has been designed from the ground up to understand streaming natively and provide a DSL for reactive and stream-oriented programming, with built-in support for backpressure. Akka Streams is a [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) and JDK 9+ [java.util.concurrent.Flow](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html)-compliant implementation and therefore [fully interoperable](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/general/stream/stream-design.html#interoperation-with-other-reactive-streams-implementations) with other implementations.

This repository contains the sources for the **Alpakka Kafka connector**. Which lets you connect [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) to Akka Streams. It was formerly known as **Akka Streams Kafka** and even **Reactive Kafka**.

Akka Stream connectors to other technologies are listed in the [Alpakka repository](https://github.com/akka/alpakka).

Caveat Emptor
-------------

Alpakka components are not always binary compatible between releases. API changes that are not backward compatible might be introduced as we refine and simplify based on your feedback. A module may be dropped in any release without prior deprecation. 

Support for the Alpakka Kafka connector is available via [Lightbend subscription](https://www.lightbend.com/subscription).
