# Alpakka Kafka Documentation

The [Alpakka project](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/alpakka/current/) is an open source initiative to implement stream-aware and reactive integration pipelines for Java and Scala. It is built on top of @extref[Akka Streams](akka-docs:stream/index.html), and has been designed from the ground up to understand streaming natively and provide a DSL for reactive and stream-oriented programming, with built-in support for backpressure. Akka Streams is a [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) and JDK 9+ @extref[java.util.concurrent.Flow](java-docs:docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html)-compliant implementation and therefore @extref[fully interoperable](akka-docs:general/stream/stream-design.html#interoperation-with-other-reactive-streams-implementations) with other implementations.

This **Alpakka Kafka connector** lets you connect [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) to Akka Streams. It was formerly known as **Akka Streams Kafka** and even **Reactive Kafka**.
