# Alpakka Kafka 1.0-RC2

Released 2019-02-21

## Second release candidate for Alpakka Kafka 1.0

We're now reaching the end of the [Road to Alpakka 1.0](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/08/30/alpakka-towards-1.0) and are very close to finish things up in both the main [Alpakka project](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/) and Alpakka Kafka. From version 1.0 Alpakka will stay [binary-compatible](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html#binary-compatibility-rules) between minor releases.

We do not expect any further changes before releasing Alpakka Kafka 1.0 final!

## Highlights in this release

* Expose consumer and producer factories as API @github[#719](#719) by [@charlibot](https://github.com/charlibot) and @github[#710](#710) by [Benoit Maggi, @bmaggi](https://github.com/bmaggi)

* Keep to the commit refresh deadlines per partition @github[#701](#701) by [Philippus Baalman, @Philippus](https://github.com/Philippus)

* Testkit support for JUnit 5 and use of [sbt-jupiter-interface](https://github.com/maichler/sbt-jupiter-interface) internally @github[#691](#691) (with great support by [Michael Aichler, @maichler](https://github.com/maichler/))

* Upgrade to Akka 2.5.21 @github[#720](#720)

Everything done in this release is [in the 1.0-RC2 milestone](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/issues?q=milestone%3A1.0-RC2).

### Other highlights already in RC1

* Use Kafka client 2.x poll API [#614](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/614), investigated by [@zaharidichev](https://github.com/zaharidichev)

* **No more `WakeupException`!** The Kafka client API 2.x allows for specifying a timeout when polling the Kafka broker, thus we do not need to use the cranky tool of Kafka's `WakeupException`s to be sure not to block a precious thread. The settings to configure wake-ups are not used anymore.

* Upgrade to Kafka client 2.1.0 [#660](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/660). This upgrade makes it possible to use of the zstandard compression (with Kafka 2.1 brokers).

* Consumer shutdown is now delayed by `stop-timeout` (default 30 s) [#673](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/673). This is especially relevant for committable partitioned sources as the stage needs to stay alive until committing has finished (reported in [#672](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/672)).

* **API Change**: Alpakka Kafka consumers don't fail for non-responding Kafka brokers anymore (as they used to to after a number of `WakeupException`s). To get the connectivity check back [#674](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/issues/674) suggests a possible way forward.

* **API Change**: Standardised on spelling of `committable` in `Producer.committableSink` (`Producer.commitableSink` will be kept around throughout 1.0.x, but those methods are deprecated now) [#645](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/645)

* New `Committer.flow` for standardised committing within a continuing flow [#644](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/issues/644)

* **API Change**: The response to the metadata request `GetCommittedOffset` now contains the `TopicPartition` [#626](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/626) by [@giftig](https://github.com/giftig).

* **API Change**: Manual subscriptions (`Subscriptions.assignment`, `assignmentWithOffset`, `assignmentOffsetsForTimes`) do not allow setting a rebalance listener anymore (methods deprecated). Rebalancing does not occur for those [#639](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/639).

* Improvements to the new testkit [#656](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/656), initiated by [@johnclara](https://github.com/johnclara)'s work with the admin clients.

* Continuous integration builds are now run against *Adopt OpenJDK 8 and 11* [#641](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/641).



### Other Highlights already in M1

* New `Committer.sink` for standardised committing [#622](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/622) by [@rtimush](https://github.com/rtimush)

* Commit with metadata [#563](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/563) and [#579](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/579) by [@johnclara](https://github.com/johnclara)

* Factored out `akka.kafka.testkit` for internal and external use: see @ref:[Testing](../testing.md)

* Support for merging commit batches [#584](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/584) by [@rtimush](https://github.com/rtimush)

* Reduced risk of message loss for partitioned sources [#589](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/589)

* Expose Kafka errors to stream [#617](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/617)

* Java APIs for all settings classes [#616](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/616)

* Much more comprehensive tests
