# Alpakka Kafka 1.0-RC1

Released 2018-12-??

## First release candidate for Alpakka Kafka 1.0

On this [Road to Alpakka 1.0](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/08/30/alpakka-towards-1.0) we may introduce non-compatible API changes. From version 1.0 Alpakka will stay [binary-compatible](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html#binary-compatibility-rules) between minor releases.

Having that said, Alpakka Kafka will start to make use of the `@ApiMayChange` annotation to keep the door open for API changes, so that new feature API can evolve more rapidly than other parts of Alpakka Kafka.


## Highlights in this release

* Use Kafka client 2.x poll API [#614](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/614), investigated by [@zaharidichev](https://github.com/zaharidichev)

* **No more `WakeupException`!** The Kafka client API 2.x allows for specifying a timeout when polling the Kafka broker, thus we do not need to use the cranky tool of Kafka's `WakeupException`s to be sure not to block a precious thread. The settings to configure wake-ups are not used anymore.

* Upgrade to Kafka client 2.1.0 [#660](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/660). This upgrade makes it possible to use of the zstandard compression (with Kafka 2.1 brokers).

* Consumer shutdown is now delayed by `stop-timeout` (default 30 s) [#673](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/673). This is especially relevant for committable partitioned sources as the stage needs to stay alive until committing has finished (reported in [#672](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/672)).

* **API Change**: Alpakka Kafka consumers don't fail for non-responding Kafka brokers anymore (as they used to to after a number of `WakeupException`s). To get the connectivity check back [#674](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/issues/674) suggests a possible way forward.

* **API Change**: Standardised on spelling of `committable` in `Producer.committableSink` (`Producer.commitableSink` will be kept around throughout 1.x, but those methods are deprecated now) [#645](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/645)

* New `Committer.flow` for standardised committing within a continuing flow [#644](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/issues/644)

* **API Change**: The response to the metadata request `GetCommittedOffset` now contains the `TopicPartition` [#626](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/626) by [@giftig](https://github.com/giftig).

* **API Change**: Manual subscriptions (`Subscriptions.assignment`, `assignmentWithOffset`, `assignmentOffsetsForTimes`) do not allow setting a rebalance listener anymore (methods deprecated). Rebalancing does not occur for those [#639](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/639).

* Continuous integration builds are now run against *Adopt OpenJDK 8 and 11* [#641](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/641).


## Improved documentation

* All examples now use the `Committer` instead of `commitJavadsl`/`commitScaladsl`.

* Most examples now show the use of `DrainingControl`.

* The Java examples shown in the documentation are now run in the tests [#665](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/665).

* Show transitive dependencies in the documentation [#657](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/657)



Everything done in this release is [in the 1.0-RC1 milestone](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/issues?q=milestone%3A1.0-RC1).

### Other Highlights already in M1

* Factored out `akka.kafka.testkit` for internal and external use: see @ref:[Testing](../testing.md)

* Support for merging commit batches [#584](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/584) by [@rtimush](https://github.com/rtimush)

* Reduced risk of message loss for partitioned sources [#589](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/589)

* Expose Kafka errors to stream [#617](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/617)

* Java APIs for all settings classes [#616](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/616)
