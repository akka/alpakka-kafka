# 3.0.1

## Noteworthy

This version [bumped the kafka client](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/1490) which changes a default config as mentiond [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-679%3A+Producer+will+enable+the+strongest+delivery+guarantee+by+default). The following error can show up in the logs:

```
org.apache.kafka.common.errors.ClusterAuthorizationException: Cluster authorization failed

```

In that case the following config needs to be provided in order to set the right default:

```
akka.kafka.producer.kafka-clients.enable.idempotence=false
```
