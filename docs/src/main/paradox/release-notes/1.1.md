# Alpakka Kafka 1.1

## Alpakka Kafka 1.1 to upgrade the Apache Kafka client to 2.1.1

The Apache Kafka client 2.1.0 contained a few annoying bugs which disturb proper operations.

Most notably: [Kubernetes - Kafka clients are resolving DNS entries only one time (KAFKA-7755)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7755)
