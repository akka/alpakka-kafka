Alpakka Kafka 1.1 changes the internals of how offset commits are sent to the Kafka broker. The new implementation is very beneficial for high-throughput consumers as committing is now connected to the regular polling of the Kafka consumer, which reduces pressure on Kafka.

It adds a new source for advanced usage: `committablePartitionedManualOffsetSource` which may be used when offsets are stored external to Kafka, but tools for consumer lag which rely on offsets being committed to Kafka are in use.

As a new experimental feature, offset committing is now possible without applying backpressure to the stream when commits are not processed at the same speed. This can be controlled via the `delivery` committer setting.

Exceptions from the Kafka consumer API are now properly passed back and fail the stream.

This goes along with a few improvements to the documentation.
