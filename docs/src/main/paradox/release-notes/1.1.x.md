# 1.1.0-RC1

Released: 2019-09-05

Alpakka Kafka 1.1 changes the internals of how offset commits are sent to the Kafka broker. The new implementation is very beneficial for high-throughput consumers as committing is now connected to the regular polling of the Kafka consumer, which reduces pressure on Kafka.

As a new experimental feature, offset committing is now possible without applying backpressure to the stream when commits are not processed at the same speed. This can be controlled via the `delivery` committer setting.

Exceptions from the Kafka consumer API are now properly passed back and fail the stream.

This goes along with a few improvements to the documentation.

**If we do not get any reports that speak against it, we'll release Alpakka Kafka 1.1.0 in a few weeks.**

## Notable changes since 1.0.5

- Introduce setting for committing without backpressure [#883](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/883)
- Capture exceptions from Kafka consumer and pass to involved stages [#887](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/pull/887)
