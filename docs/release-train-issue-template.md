# Release Train Issue Template for Alpakka Kafka

(Liberally copied and adopted from Scala itself https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/blob/b11cd2e4a4431de7867db6b39362bea8fa6650e7/notes/releases/template.md)

For every Alpakka Kafka release, make a copy of this file named after the release, and expand the variables.
Ideally replacing variables could become a script you can run on your local machine.

Variables to be expanded in this template:
- $ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$=??? 

Key links:
  - akka/alpakka-kafka milestone: https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/milestone/?

### ~ 1 week before the release

- [ ] Check that open PRs and issues assigned to the milestone are reasonable
- [ ] Decide on planned release date
- [ ] Notify depending projects (notably Lagom) about the upcoming release
- [ ] Create a new milestone for the [next version](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/milestones)
- [ ] Check [closed issues without a milestone](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20no%3Amilestone) and either assign them the 'upcoming' release milestone or `invalid/not release-bound`

### 1 day before the release

- [ ] Make sure all important / big PRs have been merged by now
- [ ] Communicate that a new version is about to be released in [Gitter Akka Dev Channel](https://gitter.im/akka/dev), so that no new Pull Requests are merged

### Preparing release notes in the documentation / announcement

- [ ] If this is a new minor (not patch) release, rename the 'akka-stream-kafka-x.x-stable' reporting project in [WhiteSource](https://saas.whitesourcesoftware.com/Wss/WSS.html#!project;id=559915) accordingly (unfortunately this requires permissions that cannot be shared outside of Lightbend)
- [ ] Add a release notes entry in `docs/src/main/paradox/release-notes/` listing contributors generated by [`sbt-authors`](https://github.com/2m/authors) (eg. `sbt authors v0.22 HEAD`)
- [ ] Create a news item draft PR on [akka.github.com](https://github.com/akka/akka.github.com), using the milestone
- [ ] Move all [unclosed issues](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A$ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$) for this milestone to the next milestone
- [ ] Release notes PR has been merged

### Cutting the release

- [ ] Make sure there are no stray staging repos on Sonatype
- [ ] Wait until master build finished after merging the release notes
- [ ] Create a [new release](https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/releases/new) with the next tag version `v$ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$`, title and release description linking to announcement, release notes and milestone
- [ ] Check that Travis CI release build has executed successfully (Travis will start a [CI build](https://travis-ci.org/akka/alpakka-kafka/builds) for the new tag and publish artifacts to Bintray)
- [ ] Go to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/akka/maven/alpakka-kafka) and select the just released version
- [ ] Go to the Maven Central tab and sync with Sonatype
- [ ] Log in to Sonatype to close the staging repository (optional, should happen automatically if selected in Bintray)
- [ ] Release the staging repository to Maven Central

### Publish docs to Gustav

- [ ] Execute steps below (This requires access to *gustav*)
1. Checkout the newly released tag.
1. If you need to make any changes to the already released docs, create `version.sbt` and set the project version explicitly:
    ```
    ThisBuild / version := "$ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$"
    ThisBuild / isSnapshot := false
    ```
1. Build paradox and API documentation:
    ```
    sbt docs/paradox core/doc
    ```
1. Upload docs to *gustav*:
    ```
    rsync -azP docs/target/paradox/site/main/ gustav.akka.io:www/docs/akka-stream-kafka/$ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$/
    rsync -azP core/target/scala-2.12/api/ gustav.akka.io:www/api/akka-stream-kafka/$ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$/
    ```

### Check availability
- [ ] Check release on [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/com/typesafe/akka/akka-stream-kafka_2.12/$ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$/)
- [ ] Check the release on [Maven central](http://central.maven.org/maven2/com/typesafe/akka/akka-stream-kafka_2.12/$ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$/)

### When everything is on maven central
- [ ] Log into `gustav.akka.io` as `akkarepo` and update the `current` links on `repo.akka.io` to point to the latest version with
     ```
     ln -nsf $ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$ www/docs/akka-stream-kafka/current
     ln -nsf $ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$ www/api/akka-stream-kafka/current
     ```
     
### Announcements
- [ ] Merge draft news item for [akka.io](https://github.com/akka/akka.github.com)
- [ ] Send a release notification to [Lightbend discuss](https://discuss.akka.io)
- [ ] Tweet using the akkateam account (or ask someone to) about the new release
- [ ] Announce on [Gitter akka/alpakka-kafka](https://gitter.im/akka/alpakka-kafka)

### Afterwards
- [ ] Update Alpakka Kafka dependency in Alpakka main repository
- [ ] Create/update PR in [Lagom](https://github.com/lagom/lagom) to upgrade to $ALPAKKA_KAFKA_VERSION$
- [ ] Update version for [Lightbend Supported Modules](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/reactive-platform/2.0/supported-modules/#other-akka-modules) in [private project](https://github.com/lightbend/reactive-platform-docs/blob/master/build.sbt#L77)
- Close this issue
